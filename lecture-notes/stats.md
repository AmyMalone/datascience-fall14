## Statistical Inference

- Statistical inference is the discipline that concerns itself with the development of procedures, methods, and theorems that allow us to extract meaning and information from data that has been generated by stochastic (random) processes.
- Process of going from the world to the data, and then back to the world

## Populations vs Samples

- Population: any set of objects or units under consideration
    - N typically represents the total number of observations in the population
- Sample: a subset of the data
    - n typically used to represent the number of samples
- Aspects:
    - Sampling effective at reducing the data you need to analyze
    - Bias in sampling: need to be very careful when generalizing inferences drawn from a sample

- Cupid's prescription:
    - What's the problem?

- Gold Standard: Randomized Clinical Trials
    - Some people receive "treatment", others in a "control" group
    - Picked randomly to take care of all confounding factors
    - Problems:
        - Ethically feasible only if **clinically equipose**
        - Very expensive and cumbersome
        - Impossible in many cases
    - Recall: Recent Facebook experiment on emotions
    - OKCupid also admits to doing some testing like this
