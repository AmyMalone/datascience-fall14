Kate Middleton Rumors: Prince William Still Partying, Wardrobe Malfunction Annoys Queen
Middleton
Now that Kate Middleton has returned to the public eye after her severe bout of morning sickness, you would have thought that press reports regarding her pregnancy would have quietened down. Unfortunately, thats not the case, and several rumors regarding her private life, including her relationship with the Queen, have all circulated over the last few days.

Of course, none of these reports have been confirmed in any fashion, and they should all be taken with a huge does of salt.

Earlier this week, the Duchess of Cambridge made her first public appearance since her second pregnancy was announced over a month ago. Alongside Prince William, she greeted the President of Singapore to the British capital. Not only did she look healthy, but she was also her delightfully charismatic self as she talked to the visitor.

According to Hallels, Kate did have a little worry on her mind, as she has become a little concerned following Prince Williams party antics recently. This report is given some credence by a Daily Mail report [via Womans Day] from last month that stated Prince William almost lost a tooth at a friends wedding. William is believed to have been dancing a bit too vigorously at the soiree when his close friend, Tom Inskip, accidentally hit him in the face, a move that almost led to all of Williams front tooth being knocked out. The second-in-line to become the head of the British monarchy was even allegedly rushed to an emergency dentist where the damage was quickly fixed.

According to a source for the Daily Mail, William made sure the tooth was repaired because he was worried Kate was going to go completely spare.

Both Celeb Dirty Laundry and The Hollywood Gossip have also added to Kates woes by insisting that her return to the limelight earlier this week wasnt completely without controversy. Thanks to Londons blustery conditions, her dress was briefly lifted up to reveal a small part of her thigh, and both of the aforementioned publications have insisted that the Queen and Camilla Parker Bowles were furious with Kates inability to protect her modesty.

If this story is actually true, then its quite harsh on Kate who Im sure doesnt go out of her way to display her skin. The Queen and Camilla should be blaming the English weather for the incident, not Kate. Or maybe they just want her to dress like a nun instead? Either way, lets just be grateful that Kate has now closer to full fitness, and hope that she has a safe and healthy pregnancy.

So when I see Kendall Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Cara Delevingne the industry is desperately in need of names and I think social media has allowed models to burst away from the pack and be known for being models and being able to compete now with actresses and singers that have been taking the covers of magazines and advertisements. Im really proud of those girls, including Kendall.
